// Hand-written "intended meaning" decoy statements, one set of 7 per source
// passage in `Passages` (src/consts/passages.tsx). None of these reference
// specific words/names/phrases from their passage - they're meant to feel
// plausible as a stated intent behind a blackout poem drawn from that
// passage without being checkable against its literal vocabulary.
//
// Style is deliberately varied on two axes:
//  - within each passage's 7, no two statements share a sentence format, so
//    the real statement can't be picked out by tone/structure alone.
//  - across passages, the *set* (and order) of formats used is different
//    each time - a participant who sees several trials over the course of
//    the study shouldn't be able to learn "the real one is always phrased
//    like X" or "decoys are always phrased like Y".
//
// Used as the statement pool for the audience preview/test assignment
// (see `audienceTestAssignment.ts`): the first 4 entries stand in as the
// "real" statement for each of the 4 test poems, the last 3 are shared
// decoys rotated across all four statement-match trials.
