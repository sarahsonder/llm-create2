    text: "Zooming through a Stockholm intersection on his bicycle one morning, 18-year-old Max Tegmark never saw the truck that hit him. The blast of a horn, the screech of tires and a sickening thud followed in quick succession, extinguishing a young life filled with promise. It never happened, of course. As the adult Dr. Tegmark, now 46, relates in the opening pages of this provocative new book, young Max swerved at the last instant and continued on to school — and an academic career that eventually took him to the faculty of M.I.T. and the top ranks of the world’s cosmologists. But wait: That fatal accident did happen, Dr. Tegmark writes. Yes, he came through unscathed that day, but he was also killed, and he was severely injured, and slightly injured. He endured every possible outcome, happy and unhappy, that can befall a bicyclist who encounters a speeding truck.",

    text: "Thermal, Calif. — “People are getting more brave, which I love, just embracing it,” said Kelson Berkus, 30, a marketing executive in Los Angeles, nodding approvingly as he surveyed the Lacoste party, clad in aqua giraffe print swim trunks (source: “probably Fred Segal”). A few steps away, Ryan Greeley, 28, a former model who works in retail in Long Beach, Calif., stepped out of the pool and pulled what appeared to be a large piece of cheesecloth (it was actually vintage, from Buffalo Exchange) close to his chest. “I call it a shawl, but that’s just because it’s a cardigan that’s mesh,” Mr. Greeley said. It was the first weekend of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and around him, hundreds of young men milled about, clad in sleeveless shirts and short shorts, hoisting up vodka sodas enthusiastically (“Let’s do this, bro!”), reliving the previous night’s excesses (“Ugh, the ceiling was spinning”) and puffing up their pecs as they strutted around the private estate here.",

    text: "How do events from our childhood shape our adult preferences? I recently studied this question using a classic American example: baseball. I tested how a team’s performance at every age of our childhood affects which team we root for as adults. From Facebook’s publicly available advertising platform, I downloaded data on how many fans every baseball team has, broken out by gender and age. (Facebook estimates whether someone is a fan of a team based on both “likes” and posts.) This data is not perfect, but it does correlate pretty well with previous polling. According to Facebook, the most popular teams are the Yankees, Red Sox, Mets, Cardinals and Braves; there are 1.65 Yankees fans for every Mets fan. Facebook data can reveal patterns that polls generally do not have large enough sample sizes to detect. For example, Facebook tells us that among men, the ratio of Yankees fans to Mets fans fluctuates enormously depending on when those men were born.",
