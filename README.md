There is an inherently social aspect to creativity. It is the driving force that builds culture and society, and whether through direct or indirect, all creative processes involve some interaction with others [1,2]. This makes the relationship between the artist and the audience one of the most fundamental aspects of the creative process.  Now, with the progressive growth and integration of generative AI into daily activities, including the creative process, what does that mean for the future of human creativity?

In this first part of the project, we explore the two questions: “How does the use of Large Language Models during the creative process impact an individual?” and “How does the use of Large Language Models at different points in the creative process impact the creative output?”

Our experimental design involves two phases: one for artists and another for the audience. In the artist phase, participants are tasked with writing a blackout poem. Each participant is assigned to one of three conditions (control, spark, writing), which determines when and how they can use AI to complete their poem. These poems are then evaluated by participants in the audience experiment.

We plan to continue this research in a second part through a longitudinal field study.
